# Release Notes

## Version 1.0.7 - Comprehensive Monitorin### üîå **Offline Handling & Reliability** üÜï

#### **Comprehensive Offline Detection**
- Automatic detection when switch becomes unreachable
- Multiple detection methods: SSH timeouts, connection errors, no data response
- Timeout-based detection for long-term offline switches (3√ó refresh interval)

#### **Entity Availability Management**
- All entities become "unavailable" in Home Assistant when switch is offline
- No stale cached data displayed during network outages
- Automatic recovery when switch connectivity is restored
- Graceful command failures with informative warnings

#### **Enhanced Monitoring & Logging**
- Clear state transition logs: "Switch X.X.X.X went offline" / "is back online"
- Specific failure reason reporting (timeout, connection error, no data)
- Smart logging that only reports actual state changes (reduces log noise)
- Manual connectivity testing capability for diagnostics

#### **User-Friendly Experience**
- No manual intervention required for offline/online transitions
- Clear visual feedback in Home Assistant (unavailable vs stale data)
- Reliable recovery without needing integration restart
- Better troubleshooting with informative error messages

### ‚öôÔ∏è **Technical Improvements**

#### **Critical Parsing Fix** üêõ
- Fixed major bug where all ports showed as "off" despite being administratively enabled
- Root cause: "Port Enabled" lines were misidentified as interface headers
- Improved interface header detection to prevent parsing conflicts
- All ports now correctly display their administrative enable/disable state

#### **Optimized SSH Operations** 
- Single SSH session for all commands instead of multiple connections
- Combined command execution with intelligent output parsing
- Reduced connection overhead and improved reliability

#### **Enhanced HP/Aruba Compatibility**
- Better parsing of comma-separated statistics
- Improved interface brief format support  
- Enhanced PoE status detection and parsing
- Support for various HP/Aruba output formats

#### **Rich Entity Attributes**
- Switch entities expose comprehensive port data
- Traffic statistics, link details, and timestamps
- PoE entities include detailed power information
- Perfect for advanced automations and dashboardsres
