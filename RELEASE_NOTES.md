# Release Notes

## Version 1.0.7 - One SSH to rule them all!
**September 27, 2025**

#### **Single SSH Session Architecture** üöÄ
**MAJOR ARCHITECTURAL IMPROVEMENT**: Completely redesigned to use proper coordinator pattern eliminating concurrent SSH connection issues.

**Before (Problematic):**
- individual entities making separate SSH calls during setup
- Multiple simultaneous SSH sessions overwhelming the switch
- Setup timeouts and `CancelledError` exceptions
- Poor performance and reliability issues

**After (Proper Architecture):**
- **Single coordinator** manages ONE SSH session for entire integration
- Uses Home Assistant's `DataUpdateCoordinator` pattern with `CoordinatorEntity`
- Executes 4 SSH commands every 30 seconds to collect data for ALL ports

**Performance Benefits:**
- ‚ö° Faster setup (seconds instead of timeouts)
- üîí Switch protection (no overwhelming with connections)  
- üìä Efficient bulk data collection for all entities
- üõ°Ô∏è Eliminates race conditions and connection conflicts

#### **Rich Entity Attributes**
- Switch entities expose comprehensive port data
- Traffic statistics, link details, and timestamps
- PoE entities include detailed power information
- Perfect for advanced automations and dashboards

### ‚ú® **New Monitoring Features**

#### **Port Activity Sensors**
- Real-time port activity monitoring (active/idle status)
- Traffic rate calculations with threshold-based activity detection
- Detailed traffic statistics in sensor attributes

#### **Traffic Statistics Sensors** 
- Individual bytes in/out sensors per port
- Individual packets in/out sensors per port
- Total increasing counters for long-term monitoring

#### **Switch Connectivity Sensor** üÜï
- Real-time switch online/offline status monitoring

### ‚öôÔ∏è **Configuration Enhancements**

#### **Options Flow Support**
- Added ability to modify configuration after initial setup
- Access via Settings ‚Üí Devices & Services ‚Üí HP/Aruba Switch ‚Üí Configure
- No need to delete and re-add integration for configuration changes

#### **Reconfigurable Settings**
- Username and password (with connection validation)
- SSH port and port count settings
- Port exclusions and PoE port exclusions
- Refresh interval (10-300 seconds with validation)

#### **Enhanced User Experience**
- Real-time credential validation when changing username/password
- Automatic entity reload when configuration changes
- Multi-language support for options flow
- Improved error handling and user feedback

#### **Expanded Language Support**
- Added Dutch (Netherlands/Belgium) translation
- Added Portuguese (Brazil/Portugal) translation
- Added Polish (Poland) translation
- Added Russian (Russia/CIS) translation
- Total of 9 supported languages for global accessibility

### ÔøΩ **Technical Improvements**

#### **Optimized SSH Operations** 
- Single SSH session for all commands instead of multiple connections
- Combined command execution with intelligent output parsing
- Reduced connection overhead and improved reliability

#### **Rich Entity Attributes**
- Switch entities expose comprehensive port data
- Traffic statistics, link details, and timestamps
- PoE entities include detailed power information
- Perfect for advanced automations and dashboards
