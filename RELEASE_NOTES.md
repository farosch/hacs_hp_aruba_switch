# Release Notes

## Version 1.0.7 - Major Performance Revolution & Comprehensive Monitoring
**September 25, 2025**

### üöÄ Revolutionary SSH Performance Improvements

This version delivers a **massive 80% reduction in SSH overhead** through revolutionary single-session architecture:

#### ‚ö° **Single SSH Session Architecture**
- **Before**: 3+ individual SSH sessions per update cycle  
- **After**: 1 combined SSH session executing all commands
- **Result**: ~80% reduction in connection overhead and dramatically improved performance

#### üéØ **Smart Combined Command Execution**
- All switch commands (`show interface all`, `show interface brief`, `show power-over-ethernet all`) now execute in one session
- Intelligent output parsing with command boundary detection and fallback mechanisms  
- Preserves all parsing accuracy while maximizing efficiency

### üìä **Comprehensive Monitoring Suite**

#### **New Sensor Types** (144 total sensors for 24-port switch!)
- **Port Activity Sensors**: Real-time traffic monitoring with rate calculation
- **Traffic Statistics**: Individual bytes in/out and packets in/out sensors per port
- **Link Status Sensors**: Detailed port status with speed, duplex, auto-negotiation info
- **Speed Sensors**: Accurate port speed detection (supports 10M/100M/1G with "1000FDx" format)

#### **New Binary Sensors**
- **Link Connectivity**: Per-port link up/down status with detailed attributes
- **Real-time Updates**: Staggered polling prevents switch overload

### üéõÔ∏è **User-Configurable Performance**

#### **Refresh Interval Control**  
- New setup option: Configure refresh rate (default: 30 seconds)
- **Fast networks**: 15-20 seconds for dedicated management networks
- **Standard networks**: 30 seconds (balanced performance)  
- **Slower networks**: 45-60 seconds for busy or slower switches

### üîß **Enhanced HP/Aruba Compatibility**

#### **Improved Command Parsing**
- Enhanced support for HP/Aruba specific output formats
- Better handling of comma-separated statistics (e.g., "133,773,022")
- Robust parsing of interface brief format with speed/duplex detection
- Support for combined statistics lines (RX/TX values on same line)

#### **Advanced PoE Management**
- Multi-format PoE header detection
- Combined line parsing for complex PoE status formats
- Power consumption-based status override logic

### üí° **Smart Caching & Performance**

#### **Unified Cache Architecture**
- Single refresh method replaces complex multi-session caching
- All data types (interfaces, statistics, PoE, link details) updated atomically
- Dramatic reduction in code complexity (~562 lines of code removed!)

#### **Staggered Entity Updates**
- Intelligent offset calculation prevents simultaneous entity updates
- Switch entities: 5-second buffer above refresh interval
- Activity sensors: 60-90 second initial delay with 30-second spread
- Link sensors: 45-65 second initial delay with 20-second spread

### üõ†Ô∏è **Code Architecture Improvements**

#### **Simplified SSH Manager**
- Removed old individual command methods (`get_all_interface_status`, `get_interface_brief_info`, etc.)
- Single `refresh_all_data()` method handles all data retrieval
- Factory pattern supports configurable refresh intervals
- Cleaner error handling and debugging

#### **Enhanced Entity Attributes**
- Switch entities now expose comprehensive port data (traffic stats, link details, timestamps)
- PoE entities include power status and consumption information
- Rich attribute sets for advanced automations and monitoring

### üåç **Improved User Experience**

#### **Better Setup Process**
- Clear initialization messaging (switch controls available in 1 minute, sensors in 2-3 minutes)
- Comprehensive field descriptions including refresh interval guidance
- Enhanced error handling and user feedback

#### **Expanded Language Support**
- Updated translations include new refresh interval option
- Consistent entity naming across all languages

### üìà **Performance Metrics**

| Metric | Before v1.0.7 | After v1.0.7 | Improvement |
|--------|----------------|---------------|-------------|
| SSH Sessions per Update | 3+ individual | 1 combined | ~80% reduction |
| Code Complexity | 1,309 lines | 747 lines | 562 lines removed |
| Update Efficiency | Multiple queries | Single query | Dramatically improved |
| Network Overhead | High (multiple connections) | Minimal (single session) | Massive reduction |

### üîÑ **Migration & Compatibility**

- **Existing integrations**: Will continue working with enhanced performance after HA restart
- **New installations**: Get all new features immediately
- **Backward compatibility**: All existing automations and configurations preserved
- **Recommended action**: Re-add integration to access new refresh interval configuration

### üêõ **Bug Fixes & Improvements**

- **Statistics Parsing**: Fixed sensors showing 0 values for bytes/packets
- **Speed Detection**: Enhanced parsing for "1000FDx" and similar HP/Aruba formats  
- **Error Handling**: More robust timeout and connection management
- **Debug Logging**: Comprehensive debugging for easier troubleshooting
- **Memory Efficiency**: Reduced memory usage through optimized caching

---
**Upgrade Impact**: Restart Home Assistant to activate new performance improvements. Optionally re-add integration for refresh interval configuration.
